          As a junior developer, I challenged myself to build WorldWise, a web
          app simulating the complexity of large-scale projects. It helps users
          organize travel goals while pushing me to tackle advanced concepts
          like state management, responsive design, and scalable
          architectureâ€”bridging the gap between beginner and professional
          development.
